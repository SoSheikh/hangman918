## Description
This project implements a text-based Hangman game in Python. The aim of the project is to provide an interactive game where users can guess letters to complete a hidden word. Through this project, I learned about Python programming, user input handling, and game logic.

## Installation Instructions

2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd hangman-game`
3. Install dependencies (if any): `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the game: `python hangman.py`

## Usage Instructions
- Enter a single letter to guess the hidden word.
- The game provides feedback on whether your guess is correct or incorrect.
- You have a limited number of guesses to uncover the word.

## File Structure
- `hangman.py`: Main game script.
- `wordlist.txt`: Text file containing words for the game.
